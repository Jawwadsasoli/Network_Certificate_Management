# Automated Certificate Management

This project provides a Python script to automate the management of SSL/TLS certificates on network devices. It includes functionality to check certificate expiry, renew certificates, and deploy them to multiple devices using SSH.

---

## Features

- **Certificate Expiry Check**: Automatically checks if a certificate is expiring within a specified number of days.
- **Certificate Deployment**: Deploys new certificates and private keys to network devices using SSH.
- **Service Restart**: Restarts the relevant service (e.g., HTTPS) on the device to apply the new certificate.
- **Scalable**: Supports multiple devices and can be extended to work with various certificate authorities (CAs).

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.6 or higher**: The script is written in Python and requires a compatible version.
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - `paramiko`: For SSH connections to network devices.
   - `cryptography`: For handling certificates and private keys.
3. **SSH Access**: Ensure you have SSH access to the network devices and the necessary permissions to deploy certificates.
4. **Certificate Files**: The certificate and private key files must be available in PEM format.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-certificate-management.git
   cd automated-certificate-management
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your certificate and private key files in the project directory:
   - `certificate.pem`: The SSL/TLS certificate file.
   - `private_key.pem`: The private key file.

---

## Configuration

Update the `DEVICES` dictionary in the script with the details of your network devices:

```python
DEVICES = {
    "router1": {"ip": "192.168.1.1", "username": "admin", "password": "password"},
    "switch1": {"ip": "192.168.1.2", "username": "admin", "password": "password"},
}
```

- Replace `ip`, `username`, and `password` with the appropriate credentials for your devices.

---

## Usage

Run the script to automate certificate management:

```bash
python automate_certificate_management.py
```

### What Happens?
1. The script checks if the certificate is expiring within the specified number of days (`DAYS_BEFORE_EXPIRY`).
2. If the certificate is expiring soon, it deploys the new certificate and private key to all devices listed in the `DEVICES` dictionary.
3. After deployment, it restarts the relevant service (e.g., HTTPS) on each device.

---

## Customization

- **Certificate Renewal**: Replace the placeholder certificate renewal logic with your own (e.g., integrate with Let's Encrypt or another CA).
- **Service Restart Command**: Modify the `service https restart` command in the script to match the service restart command for your devices.
- **Additional Devices**: Add more devices to the `DEVICES` dictionary as needed.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Generate or obtain a new certificate (e.g., using Let's Encrypt).
2. Save the certificate and private key as `certificate.pem` and `private_key.pem`.
3. Update the `DEVICES` dictionary with your network device details.
4. Run the script to automate certificate deployment.
